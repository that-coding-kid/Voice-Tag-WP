## Features

- Records and processes voice notes sent through WhatsApp Web
- Uses speech recognition to transcribe audio
- Identifies the addressee/recipient mentioned in the voice note
- Automatically tags the identified person in the chat

## How It Works

1. When you record a voice note in WhatsApp Web, the extension captures the audio in real-time
2. When you send the voice note, the audio is processed to:
   - Transcribe the speech to text
   - Identify who is being addressed in the message
3. The extension then automatically sends a follow-up message tagging the identified person

## Installation

### Server Setup

The extension requires a server component to process the audio. You can:

1. Use the hosted server at `https://workspace.b1c8560a-0313-4f27-ae11-8f4605e9037d.replit.dev`
2. Run the server locally:

   ```
   And set the Server URL in the extension popup to `http://localhost:5000`
